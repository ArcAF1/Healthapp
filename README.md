# Healthapp

Minimal health tracking application prototype built with Next.js and TypeScript.

This project focuses on implementing core algorithms for circadian rhythm management,
metabolic health calculations, weather based outdoor activity suggestions and
an evidence based recommendation system. The UI and backend are minimal to
keep the demo simple.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # start dev server
npm run build    # build for production
npm test         # run basic algorithm tests
```

The environment has no network access after setup, so installing packages may
fail. Consider prebuilding dependencies in your own setup if you want to run
this project.
